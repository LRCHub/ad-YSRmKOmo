Can we start again?
Can we raise an era?
Who are we who reign?
Blinded by the fear

Just a rope of sand
Makes the world go round
Lost and out of hand
The coda in the sound

Far into the silence
The resonation stays
Abandoning the violence
The exit from the maze

Time is out of joint
Reason is a loanword
Where's the counterpoint?
(In) the symphony unheard

The stories have been told
By wolfs in the fold
Sailing on the fairway of a lie

They came to tear the grace
And show a changing face
A lurid cup of hemlock they supply

Far beyond the afterglow
When all around is touch and go
For as long as the waters flow

Hold on, dream on
A light from afar
Be on, the great escape
In Arcadia

The change of paradigm
The hills we have to climb
The great escape, the riddance is our way

Into cascading light
An innervated sight
A long decisive turn, the place to stay

Far beyond the afterglow
When all around is touch and go
For as long as the waters flow

Hold on, dream on
A light from afar
Be on, the great escape
In Arcadia
